  <strong>Hi, I’m Janithashri 👋</strong><br/>
  Backend & cloud-focused engineer who enjoys building reliable systems and collaborating on real-world projects.
</p>

### 🌱 About Me

I’m an undergraduate backend developer interested in **scalable systems**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **security-aware design**.

I enjoy:
- building backend services that survive real traffic
- working close to infrastructure (cloud, networking, IAM)
- contributing to open-source with production standards
- discussing system design, trade-offs, and failure cases

Currently exploring deeper ideas around **distributed systems**, **cloud security**, and **graph-based infrastructure modeling**.

### 🤝 What I’m Open To

I’m always happy to collaborate on:
- backend-heavy open-source projects  
- cloud tooling, infra visibility, or security-focused systems  
- projects involving **AWS**, **networking**, or **system design**
- meaningful internships or research-oriented engineering work

If you maintain a project and think I could help — feel free to reach out.

- Misconfiguration analysis & secure-by-default design

**Tools**
- Docker, Git, GitHub Actions
- Neo4j (graph modeling)
- Linux, basic security tooling

---

### 🧠 Highlights 

- Contributed **production code** to CNCF Cartography (cloud infra mapping)
- Built backend automation and monitoring during **AWS internship**
